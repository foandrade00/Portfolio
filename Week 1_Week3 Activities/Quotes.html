A man does what he must - in spite of personal consequences, 
in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures - and that is the basis of all human
morality. John F. Kennedy <br/> <br/>
I do the very best I know how - the very best I can:
and I mean to keep on doing so until the end. Abraham Lincoln
