<p> How to make gingerbread cookies</p>
<hr/>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"> <i>Ingredients:</i></h2>


<h2> Flour</h2>
<p>I use all purpose flour in these cookies. I say this all the time and will say it again
  the best way to measure this is with a food scale. A HUGE influence on how your cookies 
 turn out is having the right amount of flour. Too much and the cookies will turn out dry.
  Too little and they will spread too much. Even a difference of a couple tablespoons can make
   a big difference, especially if another ingredient is measured a &lt; inaccurately 
   </p>

<h2> Baking Soda and Baking Powder</h2>

<p>After testing these cookies with just baking soda and just baking powder, I can say that 
I much preferred the resulting texture of using both. Just baking powder made a cookie that
 was a little firmer, more cakey and dried out more quickly. Just baking soda made the cookies 
 feel a little flimsy and just not the right texture I wanted. So I used mostly baking soda
  (which lends a more tender cookie that stays softer for longer), with a little baking powder
   (to be sure they had the best chewy texture).

<h2> Extra Ingredients for texture and flavor</h2>
<p>Spices and Molasses,for all the best flavor. Dark Brown Sugar,for even more flavor.
Egg, add structure and chewiness to the cookies.An important base for a cookie that gets
 creamed together with the brown sugar. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align:left;"> Baking</h2>

<p> Combine your dry ingredients. Flour, spices and some salt. Whisk em all together and set them aside.
Mix the rest of the dough. Start by creaming the butter and sugar together, then add 
the egg and vanilla extract. Next up is adding the molasses and combining everything well.
 Add the dry ingredients and mix everything together just until combined. You do not want to over mix it.
Roll out the cookie dough. Divide the cookie dough into two halves and roll them out to 
about 1/4 inch thickness between two pieces of parchment paper no flour-covered messes!
 yay!. It can help to mold the cookie dough into a little bit of a thick log before rolling
  it out so that it covers the parchment paper well. You will leave the cookies on the parchment paper to bake.
Chill the cookie dough. Once your dough is rolled out, pop it in the freezer for about 
7-8&plusmn; minutes. The amount of time can vary a little based on your freezer settings, but 
you want it to be nice and firm.
Cut out your cookies and bake them. With the cookie dough nice and firm, it should be quick
 to cut out the cookies using your favorite cookie cutters. Move the parchment paper with 
 the cut cookies over to a cookie sheet and bake them.
Decorate. Once your cookies are baked and cooling, make the simple icing and decorate
 your cookies as you like.
